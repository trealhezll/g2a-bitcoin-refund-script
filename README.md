# Bitcoin Refund Script v4.0:4?  

Alright, "Bitcoin Refund Script v4.0:4," here’s the deal—it’s about how to score free stuff from G2A using a clever little trick. Let me break it down for you step-by-step, straight from the pages.

## The Gist of It  
With this method you can grab anything on G2A—like Amazon, iTunes, or Google Play gift cards—for free. How? It’s all about a glitch that messes with G2A’s payment system using Bitcoin and a browser script. You buy something, get it delivered, and then get your Bitcoin refunded like nothing happened. The catch? It only works with orders over 0.001 BTC (about $81-$100 depending on the market).

## How It Works  
Here’s the play-by-play  
- **Tools You Need**: A browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge), the Tampermonkey extension, at least 0.001 BTC, and the special script (links are in the PDF).  
- **Step 1**: Install Tampermonkey from the extension store.  
- **Step 2**: Add the Bitcoin Refund Script into Tampermonkey by copying and pasting it into a new script window.  
- **Step 3**: Head to G2A, load up your cart with gift cards worth at least 0.001 BTC—go big, no max limit!  
- **Step 4**: Check out with Bitcoin. The script kicks in when you hit the payment page, tweaking some server-side JavaScript.  
- **Step 5**: Pay via QR code (they suggest using your phone for accuracy), wait for one blockchain confirmation (15 minutes max), and bam—G2A sends your gift card to your email.  
- **The Magic**: The script marks your order as "Expired" on your end, but G2A still processes it. They refund your Bitcoin automatically within minutes because of the glitch, but the gift card’s already yours.

## Key Warnings  
- **Bitcoin Only**: Other payment methods won’t cut it—stick to BTC.  
- **Amount Matters**: Below 0.001 BTC, the refund won’t trigger automatically, and contacting support will blow your cover (they’ll see the order went through and deny you).  
- **Account Stuff**: Sometimes G2A asks you to sign in—use "Continue with Google" for speed. Temp emails might flop with "expired link" errors.

## What Happens Next  
Once you pay, you’ll either see "No payment detected" (wait longer) or "Session expired" (jackpot—you’ve won). The refunds hit in 1-15 minutes, depending on blockchain speed. Ive tested it hundreds of times, scoring a $500 Amazon gift cards since the beginning of 2025, with refunds landing 12 minutes later on average. I have email screenshot for proof.

## Troubleshooting  
If it flops (like payment methods won’t load), the PDF’s got fixes:  
1. Clear cookies.  
2. Switch emails (Gmail’s best).  
3. Use a VPN (they like NordVPN) to change your IP.  
4. Go incognito and tweak Tampermonkey to run in private mode.

## The Hustle Behind It  
I have been at this for six months, figuring it out through trial and error as G2A kept patching their site. After i get the gift cards i sell them on Paxful for Bitcoin afterward, turning it into a cash machine. No hard numbers on earnings,(easily over $50,000) it’s worth the effort.
